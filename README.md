# img2base64

Simple Python 3 GUI tool which allows to quickly get the string representing the 
base64 encoding of an image file.

### Usage ###

Download the script and make it executable

```sh
sudo chmod 755 img2base64.py
```

Execute:

```sh
./img2base64.py
```

If everything went fine, a single window comes on screen: 
open an image file (actually only .png and .jpg) pressing 
the `open file` button, then press `encode` and finally copy the resulting string to 
your clipboard clicking the `copy to clipboard` button.
